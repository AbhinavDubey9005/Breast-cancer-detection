# Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a **Breast Cancer Detection system** using machine learning algorithms on the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)**. The goal is to accurately classify tumors as **malignant** or **benign** based on various features derived from cell nuclei.

---

## Dataset

The project uses the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset**, which includes 569 samples with 30 features each. Features describe characteristics of cell nuclei such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more. The target variable indicates whether a tumor is **malignant (0)** or **benign (1)**.

The dataset is included in this repository as `breast_cancer_data.csv`.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Programming language for implementation.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data handling and numerical operations.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization and plotting.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development and experimentation.
